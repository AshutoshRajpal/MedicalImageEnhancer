#### **Option 2: Edit README Locally**

1. Open `README.md` in your text editor (like VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.).
2. Make your changes (you can copy and paste the content from above or customize it as you see fit).
3. After saving your changes, run the following Git commands to update the file on GitHub:

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Update README with new description and instructions"
git push
